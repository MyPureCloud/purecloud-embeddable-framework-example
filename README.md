# Getting Started

## TL;DR

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Edit the **example.html** and **framework.js** files.
4. Run a local server.
5. Open the **example.html** file in your browser.

You can now interact with the PureCloud Embeddable Framework APIs in real-time.

## Prerequisites

 * Git installed on your computer.
 * Node.js (with npm) installed on your computer.
 * PureCloud credentials.
 * A PureCloud OAuth client with the **Token Implicit Grant (Browser)** grant type selected.<br />
   For more information, see [Create an OAuth client (Resource Center)](https://help.mypurecloud.com/?p=188023).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

      c. Type `node server.js`.
   * macOS<br />
      a. Open a **Terminal** window.<br />
      b. Type `cd {name of your PureCloud Embeddable Framework project}`.<br />
      c. Type `sudo node server.js`.
2. In your browser, go to https://localhost/example.html.
3. Log in to the client.

You can now interact with the example page and explore the PureCloud Embeddable Framework APIs in real-time. For example, to see how click-to-dial works, click the click-to-dial link on the example page.
